# ChupoChess - About
I used this project mainly to get a bit deeper into the basic concepts of Python. Right now it is a pretty basic chess engine implementing the majority of the games' rules. It comes with a pygame based GUI and without any computer opponents.

# Acknowledgements
The following projects were a) a massive inspiration for the basic class layout and b) got me a headstart on the use of pygame, so check them out:

# Setup
To play a game of chess, just run `test.py` in the root folder.

# ToDos
Open points that I will maybe work on in the future:
* Threefold/fivefold repetition and fifty-move rule/seventy-five-move rule for draws
* Pawn promotion: User interface for choosing the desired piece 
* Undo moves 
* PGN support 
* Online GUI
* Computer/AI opponents
* Some refactoring
